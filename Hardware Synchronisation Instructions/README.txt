INSTRUCTIONS

First in order to execute the program make sure that the compiler is able to compile c++ programs.
The user must also make an input file named inp-params.txt, which specifies the parameters as follows n,k,l1,l2 where n - no. of threads, k - no. of threads, l1 - lambda1 , l2 - lambda2.
They must be written as follows:
n k l1 l2

Now for executing the program, the user must run the following commands on the terminal of code editor or the main terminal(in case of linux(make sure you are in the directory where the source code file is present)).

g++ Assgn3-Src-(ProgName)-ES21BTECH11007.cpp
(here ProgName = tas or cas or cas-bounded. write the name accordingly)
./a.out inp-params.txt	

and the code will be excecuted with the creation of output.txt respectively where the output will be written in the form as given in the question.
