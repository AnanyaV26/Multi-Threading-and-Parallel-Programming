# Multi-Threading-and-Parallel-Programming
Various experiments done to study and learn about Multi-Threading and Parallel Programming.
The following experiments are done:
1. Parallelizing Monte Carlo's Method to calculate pi using threads: We do an analysis of variation of run time with the change in the number of threads used to compute the value of pi.
2. Created a parallel sudoku validator: We do an analysis of perfomance by using both pThreads and OpenMP threads.
3. Analysing different hardware instructions used for synchronisation: We do an analysis of the average time(waiting) for each thread by using different hardware instructions with the change in the number of threads.
4. A Jurassic Park tour simulation to test synchronization using semaphores: We do an analysis of the average tour time and average ride time with the change in the umber of threads.
