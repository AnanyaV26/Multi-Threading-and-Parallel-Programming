They must be written as follows:

Now for executing the program, the user must run the following commands on the terminal of code editor or the main terminal(in case of linux(make sure you are in the directory where the source code file is present)).
g++ Asgn1_Src_ES21BTECH11007.cpp

and the code will be excecuted with the creation of output.txt where the output will be written in the form as given in the question.
